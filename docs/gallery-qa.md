# glimpse Gallery QA

Use the gallery QA harness before calling a model/prompt change production-ready. It runs the same production gallery renderer used by real sessions:

- 4 gallery scenes
- all 2-3 couple references in each generation
- scene-selected venue references from the venue upload set
- Gemini image generation
- automated quality gate for aggregate likeness, per-partner likeness, distinct partner identity preservation, venue preservation, exactly-two-partner checks, face visibility, text artifacts, extra people, and composition
- adaptive frame retries that feed quality-gate failure reasons back into the next prompt
- branded still polish
- branded motion reel

## Inputs

Prepare two folders:

```text
samples/couple/
  01-together-face-forward.jpg
  02-partner-a-clear-face.jpg
  03-partner-b-clear-face.jpg

samples/venue/
  01-exterior-facade.jpg
  02-ceremony-space.jpg
  03-reception-space.jpg
  04-architectural-detail.jpg
  05-natural-light-view.jpg
```

Couple inputs must be 2-3 clear, well-lit images. For best likeness, use this order when possible: photo 1 both partners together, photo 2 Partner A face-forward, and photo 3 Partner B face-forward. Venue inputs must include at least 5 images covering exterior/facade, ceremony, reception, architectural detail, and natural-light views. The harness applies the same production reference validation as live sessions: JPG/PNG/WebP images must be at least 1024px on each side, sufficiently bright, sufficiently sharp, and couple references must not be near-duplicates. Live venue profiles store explicit coverage metadata for each uploaded photo; the local QA harness uses the filename/order convention above to mirror those coverage slots.

## Command

```bash
pnpm run gallery:qa -- --couple ./samples/couple --venue ./samples/venue --out ./qa-output/live-gallery --style cinematic-editorial --couple-name "Avery & Morgan"
```

For production-gated QA, include `--consent-confirmed`. This records in
`quality-report.json` that the couple and venue references are authorized for
the QA run. The harness allows omitting this flag only with `--allow-nonpassing`
for local plumbing checks.

The same report records SHA-256 fingerprints for every couple and venue
reference. Agentic reviewers and the production verifier use those hashes to
confirm the QA evidence refers to the exact consented images that were reviewed.

Required environment:

```bash
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-3-pro-image
GEMINI_IMAGE_FALLBACK_MODELS=gemini-3.1-flash-image
GEMINI_IMAGE_SIZE=2K
GENERATED_IMAGE_MIN_CONTRAST=8
GENERATED_IMAGE_MIN_SHARPNESS=6
GALLERY_FRAME_ATTEMPTS=4
GEMINI_QUALITY_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
GALLERY_QUALITY_GATE=on
GALLERY_MIN_LIKENESS_SCORE=0.82
GALLERY_MIN_PARTNER_LIKENESS_SCORE=0.78
GALLERY_MIN_VENUE_SCORE=0.80
GALLERY_MIN_COMPOSITION_SCORE=0.74
```

Production QA should stay on Gemini 3 native image models: Gemini 3 Pro Image
(Nano Banana Pro) first, then Gemini 3.1 Flash Image (Nano Banana 2) if the
primary model is unavailable. Older image fallbacks can reduce reference
capacity and should not be used for production likeness QA.

## Output

The output folder contains:

- `01-*.raw.jpg` through `04-*.raw.jpg` - unbranded model outputs
- `01-*.jpg` through `04-*.jpg` - polished gallery stills
- `glimpse-motion-reel.mp4` - branded motion reel
- `quality-report.json` - model settings, input files with SHA-256 fingerprints, automated summary, scene venue refs, attempts, and judge scores
- `review.html` - contact sheet with references, raw frames, polished frames, scores, used venue refs, and operator checklist

The automated summary is a gate, not final approval. It reports:

- whether all four frames passed the judge
- whether the motion reel was produced
- total attempts and max attempts on any frame
- minimum aggregate likeness, per-partner likeness, venue, and composition scores
- distinct partner identity preservation on every frame
- warnings for missing frames, missing reel, failed generation, or failed judge results

## Manual Acceptance

Automated scores are a gate, not the final word. Before release, inspect the output and confirm:

- Both couple faces are instantly recognizable in every still.
- The venue is the uploaded venue, not a generic replacement.
- Scale, lighting, shadows, and perspective feel natural.
- There are no extra people, visible text artifacts, logos, watermarks, or warped faces/hands.
- The motion reel is suitable for venue sales follow-up.

If any item fails, tune prompts, reference selection, or thresholds and rerun the harness with the same inputs.

When the manual review passes, save `manual-acceptance.json` beside
`quality-report.json` so the production verifier has auditable launch evidence:

```json
{
  "accepted": true,
  "reviewedBy": "Your Name",
  "reviewedAt": "2026-06-20T00:00:00.000Z",
  "notes": "Both partners are recognizable in all four stills; venue and motion reel approved."
}
```

The production verifier expects the QA report to pass automatically and the
manual acceptance file to be present, and it rejects reports where
`inputs.consentConfirmed` is not `true` or the input references are missing
valid SHA-256 fingerprints, unless `--skip-qa` is used for local plumbing
checks.
