      "Premium wedding editorial photographed with natural lens depth, soft directional light, gentle highlight bloom, realistic skin texture, and strong architectural respect for the venue. Keep the space recognizable and elegant without making it look staged or artificial.",

      "Signature venue architecture, natural couple interaction, refined portrait composition, warm ambient light, and a sales-ready sense of place.",

      "Handheld-feeling portraits, quiet venue corners, architectural details, soft smiles, and warm natural light.",

    directorNotes:
      "Dreamlike wedding portraiture bathed in amber natural light, soft backlight, painterly bokeh, gentle haze, and clean face detail. Make the couple feel naturally present in the venue instead of composited into a fantasy background.",
    sceneBeats:
      "Honey-warm venue views, soft architectural silhouettes, romantic close portraits, and graceful celebration energy.",
